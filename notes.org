OneTwo, UI, Driver

driver as inbetween? controller?

UI tells driver options to start new game
driver tell onetwo options
onetwo tells driver when its done and gives it a board
driver tells UI to update board

driver either waits for ui click or gets a move from the bot - waits for toggle turn, and responds accordingly
driver tells onetwo to move
onetwo tells driver when move is done, along with some info
driver tells ui to update board




Abstractions...
Board can be its own unit (would be useful for creating boards later)
Bot module - gives move for player based on board
One-two module - holds game state, turns, etc. throws events. allows for starting game and making move. gives copy of game state to whoever asks
Player module? 

abstraction should be for local two player, local player-computer, computer-computer in bulk with stats, sockets 2-player... 

player abstracted, and some messaging system abstracted. messaging /  event system. include sockets in at the end. 


So, same way that players over socket will get messages and post messages, bot can be the same
not requiring sucha  sequential driver then

flow can be managed by events, as it should be.. 

so there are certain kind of 'agents' or 'entities' that can pub and sub to events

- player (bot is a type of player)
- game or game state 
- event handler, mediator..
- interface (ui - and cli?)

Interface features: 
- choose type of game / options
- start game
- listen to events and update GUI (listening could result in asking for a move and throwing new event.)
(bot interactivity is something like interacting from cli)




1. basic menu screen (dom or cli) - size/dead options, type of game option - 2 humans same location, 2 humans socket, human vs computer, computer vs computer 
2. game screen . if socket , if waiting show waiting, otherwise show 'connecting...' / 'joining...' if needed. 
if computer vs computer ? save file stats to disk? this should only be done on CLI..


 THinking in terms of events, (event mediator _is_ the driver/controller)

 ONe-two listens for start-game event that comes with config data
 one-two throws new-game event with game state
 view/ui/cli listens for new-game and outputs appropriately 
 view/ui/cli throws game-started event 
 Player 1 listens for game-started event, (and listen for clicks on board...? UI and Player have to interact somehow)
 player 1 throws move-made event with coords



 one-two listens for move-event 


If bot is type of player as well, 
player waits for toggle turn, and then throws event with move data...
to throw this event, 

hmmmm confusing with client-server interaction as well. earlier game was all client. now some on server.. 
so if using socket, can have server only speak back to client for for game on 1 browser window, and make pairings for two clietns as required.. 
comp vs comp? not avaialbe through browser.. create CLI for this. might not be a bad place to start? 

IS THIS BECOMING TOO COMPLICATED AGAIN? WILL THERE BE HUNDEREDS OF IF_THENS TRYING TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THIS AT SAME TIME?

save sockets for later. keep in mind and implment later

FOR NOW: 
make it playable again, everything client side
allow settings and vs computer
make computer logic



Usefulness of abstraction:
- UI becomes a module, can change look easily
- Game itself can be changed keeping event and flow structure intact
- using turn-toggled event, can have game with more players





25th September

-- sort out score functionality
-- make some sort of messaging scheme -- can make all DOM events emit custom events for consistency
-- finish handling events for human using window as event listener
